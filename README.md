A map of Paul McCartney's 2022 USA tour. His highly anticipated return to touring after being stuck in "rockdown" for the past few years. Ever since I put my parent's collection of Beatles singles CD into the stereo at age 3, I've been an unapologetic Beatles fanatic, with perhaps an unhealthy amount of obsession. Paul McCartney has always been my favorite for his master ability to craft a perfect meoldy. At age 79, (with the final show being played two days before his 80th birthday), he's back after being isolated in 'Rockdown" in his Southern England home and recording the self-produced "McCartney III" album. With Paul McCartney's Got Back USA Tour kicking off this Thursday, (28th April), I have decided to create an interactive web map advertising the tour.
